# Flybody Description (MJCF)

Requires MuJoCo 2.2.2 or later.

## Overview

flybody is an anatomically-detailed body model of the fruit fly [Drosophila melanogaster]. The fly model was developed in a collaborative effort by Google DeepMind and [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/). It is taken with permission from the [official flybody repository] ([commit SHA](https://github.com/TuragaLab/flybody/commit/736608121847c3c025fd02a629bdb016a3294f9a)). For the most up-to-date model and source of truth, the user is encouraged to refer to the [official flybody repository].

## MJCF derivation steps

* In the [`build_fruitfly` directory] of the [official flybody repository], you'll find the data and code to produce this model, with a step-by-step process detailed in the [`build_fruitfly` README].
* You can also find a detailed write up of the modeling process in the methods section of the [bioRxiv paper].
